After building the Jar file, to run it, there must be a file titled "Honors Blade" in the Desktop. Within the Honors Blade file, there also must be a file titled "Audio" which contains the corresponding audio files, which can be found within the Audio file under the src package. If you do not do this, the game will crash whenever it attempts to access an audio file to play it.
